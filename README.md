## Greeting
Hey there, thanks for checking out this PhotoLoco. I created this application for my Flatiron School Project #4: JavaScript and Rails API Project.

## Description
The idea for PhotoLoco came from my own experience: Iâ€™m trying to start my own photography side business, and one of the big parts of shooting photography (outside of a studio) is finding good locations for photos. I wanted to create a site where users could share photographable locations with other photographers. Locations are made by one user, but photos of the location can be uploaded by multiple users. In the future, I would like to add a Tag feature, so similar Locations could be found by tag, as well as a search bar for users to find locations near them.

## Installation
To use this app, clone this repository, change directories into photoloco/backend. Run `rails db:create`, `rails db:migrate`, `rails db:seed`, and then `rails s`. Then open photoloco/frontend/index.html.
